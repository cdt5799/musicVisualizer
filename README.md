# Music Visualizer

The goal of this project was to demonstrate our mastery of HTML5, CSS, JS inconjunction with the canvas element. The assignment was to create a significant HTML5 Media Experience that is visually engaging, and highly interactive. We created an experience that allows the user to visually represent sound. The user also has a variety of controls to determine what the visualization looks like.

We used the Web Audio API to process and decode frequencies of sound. From there we used the sound data to draw canvas graphics, such as line, circles, triangles, and squares to create the visual effect. We also incorporated the drag and drop features allowing users to easily choose a sound clip.
